            <p><em>Number of Players:</em> Any number of players may play, but normally two. Marks are <strong>301 or 501</strong></p>
        <strong>301</strong><br>
   <p><em style="color:red;"><!--This is an in line how to play will be color red-->How to play:</em>Each player starts with <strong>301</strong> points.<br> 
    The goal for each player is to reach zero, exactly, by subtracting the amount they score in a turn from the amount
     
    they had left from the previous turn.<br> The player cannot start subtracting until they
      <b>double in</b> or hit the <b>bulls eye</b>.<br> Once the double is hit or bulls eye, 
      then all scores will count with a mean score of <strong>41,51 or 61</strong>. <br>
      The first player to get to <b>99</b> marks from 301 dosent have to hit a mean  but
       any score hit will be subtracted.<br> To end the game, the player must also <b>double out </b> <br>
       (If they have 32 left, then they will need to hit a double 16 to win. If they then hit a single sixteen, 
       leaving 16, their next target would be a double 8.) <br>
       If they hit more points than they have left, 
       then they have busted.Throw again.</p>
       <div>
        <strong>501</strong><br><p>This game is generally played as a team event, though we also play it in our single events.<br> All players start with 501 points. Unlike 301, <b>you do not have to double-in</b>, but can start with<b>any marks</b>.<br> Each player subtracts the amount they score from the amount they have left.<br> To win, like 301 above, the player will need to <b>double-out</b> to reach zero.</p>

       <p><em>Number of Players:</em> Killer is most fun with three or more players.<br> </p>
       <p><em style="color:red;">Play:</em> A player throws one dart with the "opposite" hand.<br>
         (right-handers throw left-handed) to determine randomly his or her own number<br>
         (1-numbers for 3-lifes or 3-numbers for 1-life each).<br>
         If a player misses the dartboard or hits a number already taken, he or she throws again. </p>

    <p><em>Setup:</em>The board is setup as shown above.</p> 
   <p><em>Turns:</em>White always moves first,</p>  
   <p><em style="color:brown;">Taking Pieces:</em> Players take pieces when they encounter an opponent in their movement path. Players cannot take or move through their own pieces.</p> 
   <h5><em style="color:brown;">Pieces:</em></h5>
    <!--This a paragraph separated with br(break line)-->
    <p>
    <strong> PAWN</strong> only move forward. On the first move a pawn can move one or two spaces, every subsequent move can only be one space. Pawns move diagonally to take opponents.<br> <b>Pawn Promotion:</b> If a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it is promoted to a higher piece (except king). There is no limit to how many pawns can be promoted.<br>
    <strong>ROOK:-</strong> Rooks move in a continuous line forwards, backwards and side-to-side.<br>
    <strong>KNIGHTS:-</strong>Knights are the only pieces that "jump" off the board. Unlike other pieces they are not blocked if there are pieces between them and their destination square. <br>To make it easier to remember how a knight moves think of an L. Two spaces in a direction forward, backward or side-to-side, and one space at a right turn.<br>
    <strong>BISHOP:-</strong> Bishops move in continuous diagonal lines in any direction.<br>
    <strong>QUEEN:- </strong>The queen moves in continuous diagonal and straight lines. Forward, backward and side-to-side.<br>
   <strong>KING:-</strong>The king can move in any direction, one square at a time. A king cannot move to a square that is under attack by the opponent.<br>
